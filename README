This project's goal is to make an libswift based application for the Samsung TV.
The TV to be used is the Samsung UEXXD70XX series.

To compile binaries for the the Samsung TV, please visit opensource.samsung.com to download the correct tools.
List of things you need:

- VDLinux-armv7a8-toolchain-lite_20100630.tgz
- arm_v7_vfp_le_20091117.tgz (optional)
- 11_UE_UAxxD7xx0.tar.gz (optional, contains kernel and other built in stuff already in the TV)

To setup the toolchain, unpack the arm-v7a8 toolchain and put them somewhere you want them (usually /opt) and add them to your $PATH

To compile libevent2 for the Samsung TV, make sure you fork this repository on your home folder, otherwise you have to change some paths in the build files.

$cd swiftarm/libevent2
$./samsung-build.sh
$make
$make install

To compile libswift for the Samsung TV, just cd into the directory m48-stb-swift and run make.
If this doesn't work, make sure you have your paths set correctly.

To do the demo, transfer the swift binary you compiled to your *ROOTED* Samsung TV using ftp.
WARNING: DO NOT USE FILEZILLA OR OTHER FANCY FTP CLIENTS! THEY MODIFY THE BINARY AND GIVE A SEGFAULT!

To try it out on the TV, transfer some mp3, mp4 or other files to your device using ftp.
Don't forget to set the executable bit on for swift.

chmod +x swift

Then run the seeder.

./swift -f path_to_file/file -l 127.0.0.1:20000 -p

This will generate a root merkle hash.

To stream it to yourself, run the http binder:

./swift -t 127.0.0.1:20000 -g 127.0.0.1:1337 -w

Then run any widget that can play http streams like nStreamPlayer with modified playlist.
The http link where your stream will be is:
http://127.0.0.1:1337/root_merkle_hash
where root_merkle_hash is the hash you obtained by running the seeder.
