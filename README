This project's goal is to make an libswift based application for the Samsung TV.
The TV to be used is the Samsung UEXXD70XX series.

To compile binaries for the the Samsung TV, please visit opensource.samsung.com to download the correct tools.
List of things you need:

- VDLinux-armv7a8-toolchain-lite_20100630.tgz
- arm_v7_vfp_le_20091117.tgz
- 11_UE_UAxxD7xx0.tar.gz (optional, contains kernel and other built in stuff already in the TV)

To setup the toolchain, unpack the first two packages and put them somewere you want them (usually /opt) and add them to your $PATH

We are also working to emulate the TV correctly in QEMU.
To download qemu, please visit http://wiki.qemu.org/Download

Download the latest version, unpack and run:

./configure --target-list=arm-softmmu --enable-sdl
make
sudo make install

After this, you'll have qemu on your computer.
